# LogistIQ: Parallel AI Agent Validation for Trade Compliance

## The Problem: Documentation Errors Cost Importers Millions

While researching trade compliance, we found a case study about an importer who lost $23,000 because of a quantity typo on a packing list—"450" instead of "540." The shipment sat in customs for two weeks despite everything else being correct.
That got us thinking: why is customs documentation still so manual and error-prone?
After spending considerable time researching, we realized that mid-size importers are stuck. Enterprise compliance software starts at $50k/year (way too expensive), but manual validation takes hours per shipment and still misses things.
The problem isn't lack of rules or data—customs requirements are well-documented. The problem is that checking dozens of requirements across multiple documents is tedious work that humans do slowly and inconsistently.
That's a perfect use case for AI agents. We built LogistIQ to see if we could automate the tedious parts while keeping humans in the loop for actual decisions.

## 🚀 Our Solution: Parallel AI Agent Validation

LogistIQ validates your trade documents before you ship—catching the mistakes that cause customs nightmares.
Upload your invoice, packing list, and bill of lading as well as supporting documents like FCC or other regulatory approval documents. **Nine specialized AI agents swarm the documents simultaneously.**

In under a couple of minutes, you get a risk assessment and specific action items. High risk? The system tells you exactly what to fix. Low risk? Ship with confidence.

### Validation Completes in Seconds

- **HS tariff codes** → verified against database  
- **Document consistency** → cross-checked in real-time  
- **Regulatory requirements** → confirmed automatically  
- **Pricing anomalies** → flagged for review  
- **Supplier risk** → calculated from history  
- **Origin claims** → validated across all docs  
- **Shipping routes** → checked for red flags  
- **Final risk score** → generated with recommended actions
-**Auto-Document Repair** → takes problematic shipping documents and makes them customs ready

## 🧠 How It Works

### Agent Swarm Architecture

We built nine specialized agents, each an expert in one compliance domain:

| Agent | Responsibility |
|--------|----------------|
| **HS Code Validator** | Catches classification errors |
| **Document Checker** | Finds mismatches across invoice, packing list, and BOL |
| **Regulatory Validator** | Confirms required certifications |
| **Origin Validator** | Verifies country-of-origin claims |
| **Value Validator** | Detects pricing anomalies |
| **Route Validator** | Spots suspicious shipping patterns |
| **Supplier Analyzer** | Assesses historical risk |
| **Risk Scorer** | Synthesizes findings and makes final call |
| **Auto-Document Repair** | takes results from agents and repairs documents|

**Key innovation:** Agents run in **parallel** using the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**, coordinated by **Airia’s enterprise platform**.  
This enables *simultaneous validation* instead of sequential checking.

## ⚙️ Technical Architecture

### Core Philosophy: Data-Only Tools

We separated **data retrieval** from **decision-making**:

- design tools for agents to use when and how they want
- All interpretation happens in **agent thinking process**
- System adapts to new regulations *without code changes*

**Why this matters:**  
When customs rules change, we update **agent instructions — not tool code.**  
This makes the system *maintainable* and *adaptable*.

### Implementation Flow
MCP Tools (Python/FastMCP) –> Translation (DeepL API), Document Retrieval, Calculations, Reference Lookups –> Airia Platform –> 9 Parallel AI Agents –> Risk Assessment + Action Plan

## 📦 Real Example

**Shipment:** 500 wireless mice from China  
**logistIQ catches three issues in 8 seconds:**

1. Quantity mismatch – Invoice shows 500, packing list shows 450  
2. Missing FCC cert – Wireless device needs certification  
3. High-risk supplier – 33% customs hold rate  

**Decision:** Don’t ship. Fix documentation first.  

- **Cost to fix now:** ~$400 (two-day delay)  
- **Cost if shipped as-is:** ~$10,000+ (week-long customs hold)

💡 *One validation pays for months of service.*

## 💡 Why This Matters

Mid-size importers (100–500 shipments/month) are stuck between **expensive enterprise software** and **error-prone manual processes**.  
We built the solution that should have existed:  
**Fast enough to use on every shipment, affordable enough for growing businesses.**

The agent swarm approach **scales with complexity**:
- More document types? ➜ Add an agent  
- New regulations? ➜ Update instructions  
- Different country? ➜ Deploy localized agents  

✅ **This is trade compliance validation that actually gets used.**

### Validate in Seconds. Ship with Confidence.
